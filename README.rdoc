My second Rails app. Find your yoga class in Berlin. Determine your search by time, weekday and your favourite yoga art.  

Of course the data is fake, this project helps me to learn and understand rails. :) 

Done: 
- Relationships between classes
- Admin area and restricted admin function
- Added a terrific design ;D

TODO:
- Frontpage with fully seach (tricky for me)
- Deploy at Heroku or...!
- Improve and add require strength password validation
 

<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
